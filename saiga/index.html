				<p>This is the high-level user flow of the app. We want our users to scan their documents and leave the tedious work to software. Users who do not scan any documents have to enter in their data by hand, but still get a better, less error-prone experience than using paper.</p>

				<p>This is my minimum viable product mockup.<sup>g</sup> The app is primarily inputs for the user to populate with personal details. Our target persona, Raquel, wants to live and work in Berlin but she is flustered by boring bureaucratic paperwork.<sup>h</sup></p>
				<p>These forms need a lot of information. Instead of telling Raquel to manually answer every single question, our app makes the application process magical with a couple of photos. The app scans passports, tax forms, ID cards, and more. The app then uses the information found to automate as much of the application as possible.</p>
				<p>Because the app is focused on obtaining a German visa, we know exactly what data is needed to complete these forms. We can find the most popular expat countries and pre-load their common forms into our app.<sup>i</sup> This magic extends to outside the app as well. If the app detects from your scans that you are a Canadian diplomat, you get different instructions and rules than a Brazilian student.</p>
				<p>All Raquel does is snap some photos and answer a few questions, then we handle the rest. Important dates are added to her calendar app. In-person appointments are booked, and we give her directions to get to them. We submit her application and mail her a packet with everything she'll need in her meetings.</p>

By training the app with popular forms, it will know the difference between a W-2 from the USA and the equivalent from Ireland, and it knows where the relevant information is within them.<br><br>Less common forms make the model smarter too. Utility bills, bank statements, birth certificates and more will all make the app better and feel more magical. The goal is to allow users to scan anything they have at hand.</span></li>

				<p>Some shortcuts I took were around my key feature, the document scanner. Taking photos of important documents could be a security risk if we store or transmit sensitive data like this, so I imagined everything taking place locally on the users device, and any saved data would be stored securely. Also, I assumed Raquel understands and trusts the software enough to scan her documents.</p>
				
				<p>Another shortcut is in regards to the visa forms. I only glanced at a few of the forms and some of the instructions provided by the German government. This just about guarantees that I oversimplified <i>something</i>.</p>
				<p>I would spend more time with other people if this were a real assignment. Real people, whiteboards, and lots of papers mapping out this beast. Because the consequences of messing up someone's visa application are real, I would need as many eyes on this as possible.  Maybe even consultation with a paralegal to help.</p>
				<p>This was a fun project. Thinking through a process with this much complexity was challenging and absorbing, for sure. I had a hard time letting go when I wanted to dig into details. Sometimes I got lost in minutiae, and other times I worried my take was a little too absract. Still, I hope this has given you an idea of how I work. I even had ideas that I couldn't fit into this document, like payment (my 2 cents: users don't pay unless the app works).</p>
				<p>If you are curious, <a href="images/saiga/notes.png" class="arrow">here are my paper notes on the project</a></p>
				<p>Thank you for giving me a shot with this assignment. Even though I have finished this exercise I am still thinking of more ideas for the app, like helping people with laws and finance pertaining to visas holders after they settle into their new home. I hope this page gave you an idea of the kind of energy and potential I will bring to Saiga.</p>
