				<p>I worked at Swanson Health Products for more than six years. My first position was in their warehouse while I completed my bachelors degree.</p>
				<p>My first profressional position with the company was as a graphic designer, where I created marketing materials like emails and promotional graphics.</p>
				<p>Later, I was promoted to do front-end web development work. This is where, with the help of a fantastic manager, my love of user interface was incubated.</p>

		<h6>Subscriptions</h6>
		<p>One of the biggest projects I worked on was a ground-up replacement of our subscription service. We used a third-party service for customers to subscribe to our products. We dumped the outside company and built a replacement in-house. The in-house build was a sprawling beast of a task, touching nearly every corner of the website and involving every department in the building.</p>
		<p>I was responsible for developing the user account part of the project. Our old third-party implementation is on top, mine is below.</p>

		<h6>Forms<span class="asterisk">*</span></h6>
		<p>The forms on the site were not easy to use. I fixed them. Now customers can more easily interact with the website.</p>
		<p><span class="asterisk">*</span> This and the other projects marked with a red asterisk are projects I conceived, designed, developed, and presented to management.</p>

				<p>I wanted to change that. I imagined a single design across the site. My new design followed a refreshed brand style, promoted the newly built subscription service, and organized information more professionally.</p>

		<h6>Create Account</h6>
		<p>The old page (top) was a user experience disaster. Well, I say <i>page</i>, but there were actually <i>three slightly different pages</i> where a customer could sign in or create an account. I whittled that down to a healthy single page (bottom), and made it a little better with the help of my previous work standardizing forms, tabs, and radio buttons.</p>

				<h6>Header Concept<span class="asterisk">*</span></h6>
				<p>As you've noticed, the site is largely devoid of color and more than a little heavy-handed. I wanted to bring a more professional look to the site, starting with the background and header of the site.</p>
				<a href="images/swanson/header-concept.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
					<img class="u-max-full-width hover-effect" src="images/swanson/header-concept.png">

				<p>This concept was seen as too radical of a change and never made it beyond the drawing board.</p>

				<p>I like CSS. I just kind of get it. And I'm pretty gosh darn alright at making CSS do what I want. This is an animation I made using just CSS and an SVG &mdash; no JavaScript required.</p>
					<p>Abusing CSS like this is an absolute dog as far as performance goes, but I was <i>seriously</i> procrastinating some real work.</p>
