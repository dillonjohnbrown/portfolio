					<p>I worked at Swanson Health Products for more than six years. My first position was in their warehouse while I completed my bachelors degree. My first professional position with the company was as a graphic designer, where I created marketing materials like emails and promotional graphics.</p>
					<p>Later, I was promoted to do front-end web development work. This is where, with the help of a fantastic manager, my love of user interface was incubated.</p>
