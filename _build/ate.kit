				<p>After familiarizing myself with the app, I found a couple areas I believe could be improved.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Descriptive buttons and junk drawers</li>
					<li>Expanded use of native iOS modal stacks</li>
					<li>Better UX around the Add feature</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These items are improvements in their own right, but build upon each other to make adding meals quicker and more intuitive.</p>

				<p>As I opened the app to begin using it, iOS informed me the app took the text I had on my clipboard &mdash; my Apple ID password. Hopefully this is just a bug.</p>

				<p>My first suggestion is about buttons and what they communicate.</p>
				<p>On the Meal Detail screen I was initially unable to tell if this meal is on-path or off-path. This button behaves differently than other buttons, as it shows a status rather than an action. Other buttons describe what they do when tapped &mdash;the × will close this screen, trashcan will delete, etc.</p>
				
				<p>Elsewhere around the app there are buttons that open just one other button. Removing these unnecessary steps and using text instead of icons could make the app faster to use.</p>

				<p>Apple is expanding this interface on iOS and it is common in other apps. Modal stacks allow users to quickly swipe a screen down to dismiss it, rather than reaching across the screen to tap a button.</p>
				<p>The chat feature <i>looks</i> like this, however I was unable to dismiss the screen with a swipe. The settings screen is the opposite, where I was able to return to the profile page with a swipe, but the visual design did not reflect this.</p>
				<p>I suggest using modal stacks for the Add New, Add Friend, and Meal Detail screens, as well as updating the visuals on the Settings page.</p>

				<p>Finally, I would like to share my thoughts around the way meals are added from the <strong>Path</strong> tab. I think a few small changes would go a long way in making this feature as intuitive as possible. After adjusting to the <strong>Path</strong> tab functionality, I came to enjoy the button placement in the tab bar.</p>
				<p>At first glance, the buttons next to the Path camera button ("Text only" and "Add Other") appear to be part of the tab bar. These are not different tabs (like <strong>Profile</strong> and <strong>Friends</strong>), but are instead different ways for users to add meals.</p>

				<p>To ensure these buttons are not mistaken for tabs, I took inspiration from what you already have &mdash; the camera button. And speaking of the camera button, I hope adding an icon and changing the color to your primary brand color make its purpose undeniable.</p>
				<p>I believe these changes would help users understand these buttons as ways to input their meals into the app.</p>

				<p>Customizing the accessory button was frustrating for me. Before I was familiar with the app, I was unsure what exactly I was changing. I believe a graphic of the feature would help users understand what they are changing.</p>
				<p>This could also be an opportunity to show the features in the premium version.</p>

			<div class="two columns note">
				<p>The <strong>Save</strong> button has been removed.</p>
				<p>Automatically saving the users choice will save users a tap at the least, and at most it prevents them from failing to save their preferences then getting frustrated.</p>
