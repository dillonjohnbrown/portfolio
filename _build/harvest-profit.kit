					<p>Harvest Profit is a software company in Fargo, ND. Their products include mobile apps, consulting services, and a subscription-based web app.</p>
					<p>My work with Harvest Profit was focused on improving the way their software worked. I did this by creating a comprehensive style guide and reworking functionality with users in mind. Here are some highlights from my time working with them.</p>

				<p>Customers were unsure where to start with our software. This guide was created to address that by helping our users get started. It contains easy to follow instructions describing how they can enter the needed information to get started with the software.</p>
				<p>The guide was printed and sent to customers while we worked on an onboarding flow. You can see the full guide <a href="pdf/welcome.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<p>With Harvest Profit's software, farmers track the details of their fields. Each field can contain plantings, each planting crops, and each planting can be subdivided between different farmers or businesses (called "share agreements" in my designs, and "entity splits" on the current page).</p>
				<p>Our users wanted to apply share agreements to multiple fields (e.g., you and your neighbor often share the work on the fields where your properties meet). Our app did not have this functionality, so I got to work brainstorming how to make this process easy. I was reminded of the tags on my computer. I can make a tag, apply it to multiple files, and when I change the tag it changes everywhere. I saw this idea as the perfect solution to our problem and drafted my idea with Sketch. To simplify things, I moved share agreements into their own tab, where users would have the space to fine-tune their share agreements.</p>
