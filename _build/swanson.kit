    <h4>Swanson Health Products</h4>
    <p>I worked at Swanson Health Products for more than six years where I earned four promotions. During my time as a designer/developer I worked on more than 300 projects. Here are some of my favorites.</p>

    <div class="docs-section">
      <h6>Subscriptions</h6>
      <p>One of the biggest projects I worked on was a ground-up replacement of our subscription service. We used a third-party service for product subscriptions.  Long story short, we dumped them and built a replacement in-house. I was responsible for designing and developing the user account part of the project.</p>
      <p>Our old third-party implementation is on top, mine is below.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="docs-section">
      <h6>Forms<span class="asterisk">*</span></h6>
      <p>I took a mess of interface elements and unified them under one design language. Part of this was our form elements. Now all the forms look similar while being easy to use on any device.</p>
      <p><span class="asterisk">*</span> This and the other projects on this page marked with a red asterisk are projects I conceived, designed, developed, and presented to management.</p>

    <div class="docs-section">
      <h6>Products<span class="asterisk">*</span></h6>
      <p>Below are some of the ways you may have seen products around the site...</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">

      </div>

      <div class="row example">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>I wanted to change that. I imagined a single design across the site. My new design followed a refreshed brand style, promoted the newly built subscription service, and organized information more professionally.</p>

      <h6>address book<span class="asterisk">*</span></h6>
      <p>No comment on the DayGlo banner alert.</p>

    <div class="docs-section">
      <h6>create account</h6>
      <p>The old page (top) was a user experience disaster. Well, I say <i>page</i>, but there were actually <i>three slightly different pages</i> where a customer could sign in or create an account. I whittled that down to a healthy single page (bottom), and made it a little better with the help of my previous work standardizing forms, tabs, and radio buttons.</p>

    <div class="docs-section">
      <h6>Header<span class="asterisk">*</span></h6>
      <p>Like the header/background in all the previous screenshots? Yeah, me neither. Sadly, this was seen as too radical of a change and never made it beyond the drawing board.</p>
