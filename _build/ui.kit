				<p>Harvest Profit is a software company in Fargo, ND. Their products include a mobile app, consulting services, and a subscription-based web app.</p>
				<p>My work with Harvest Profit was focused on improving the way their software worked. I did this by creating a comprehensive style guide and reworking functionality with users in mind. Here are some highlights from my time working with them.</p>

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>Customers were unsure where to start with our software. This guide was created to address that by helping our users get started. It contains easy to follow instructions describing how they can enter the needed information to get started with the software.</p>
				<p>The guide was printed and sent to customers while we worked on an onboarding flow. You can see the full guide <a href="pdf/welcome.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

				<p>After we sent out the onboarding guide, we created this onboarding flow. It was designed to help users enter necessary data as well as connect our software to other farming apps.</p>

		<h6 id="crop-planner">Crop Planner</h6>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="twelve columns">
				<p>With Harvest Profit's software, farmers track the details of their fields. Each field can contain plantings, each planting crops, and each planting can be subdivided between different farmers or businesses (called "share agreements" in my designs, and "entity splits" on the current page).</p>
				<p>Our users wanted to apply share agreements to multiple fields (e.g., you and your neighbor often share the work on the fields where your properties meet). Our app did not have this functionality, so I got to work brainstorming how to make this process easy. I was reminded of the tags on my computer. I can make a tag, apply it to multiple files, and when I change the tag it changes everywhere. I saw this idea as the perfect solution to our problem and drafted my idea with Sketch. To simplify things, I moved share agreements into their own tab, where users would have the space to fine-tune their share agreements.</p>

		<h6>Subscriptions</h6>
		<p>One of the biggest projects I worked on was a ground-up replacement of our subscription service. We used a third-party service for customers to subscribe to our products. We dumped the outside company and built a replacement in-house. The in-house build was a sprawling beast of a task, touching nearly every corner of the website and involving every department in the building.</p>
		<p>I was responsible for developing the user account part of the project. Our old third-party implementation is on top, mine is below.</p>

		<h6>Forms</h6>
		<!-- <p>Forms are a critical, and often overlooked, p</p> -->
		<p>The biggest change I made to the forms was flipping the way required fields are handled. Previously, required inputs had an asterisk in their label. Instead, optional inputs contain a subtle placeholder. Visually, this tells you there is already something in this box &mdash; feel free to skip it.</p>
		<p>Other changes include the removal of unneeded inputs as well as colors to show state and create contrast from the white background.</p>

If some fields truly are necessary, but only apply to a subset of users, don’t make users find out through trial and error. Limit the form to only 1 or 2 optional fields, and clearly label them as optional.</blockquote>
