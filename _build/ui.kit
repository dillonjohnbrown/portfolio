				<p>Harvest Profit is a software company in Fargo, ND. Their products include a mobile app, consulting services, and a subscription-based web app.</p>
				<p>My work with Harvest Profit was focused on improving the way their software worked. I did this by creating a comprehensive design system and reviewing how every element worked. Here are some highlights from my time working with them.</p>

				<p>Customers were unsure where to start with our software. This guide was created to address that and help our users get started. It contains easy to follow instructions describing how they can enter a little bit of information to get started with the software.</p>
				<p>The guide was printed and sent to customers while we worked on an onboarding flow. You can see the full guide <a href="pdf/welcome.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

		<h6 id="crop-planner">Crop Planner</h6>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="twelve columns">
				<p>With Harvest Profit's software, farmers track the details of their fields. Each field can contain plantings, each planting crops, and each planting can be subdivided between different farmers or businesses (called "share agreements" in my designs, and "entity splits" on the current page).</p>
				<p>Our users wanted to apply share agreements to multiple fields (e.g., you and your neighbor often share the work on the fields where your properties meet). Our app did not have this functionality, so I got hard at work brainstorming how to make this process easy. I was reminded of the tags on my computer. I can make a tag, apply it to multiple files, and when I change the tag it changes everywhere. I saw this idea as the perfect solution to our problem and got to work drafting up ideas. I moved share agreements into their own tab, where users would have the space to fine-tune their share agreements.</p>

			<p>This was one of the first pages I overhauled (eagle-eyed viewers will notice some less evolved styles here). A new design language is the first thing you'll notice. More suble changes include translating Engineer-ese to English, like "Export" to "Download".</p>

					<p>This feature helps farmers keep track of every kernel of product on their farm and where it winds up. On this prototype I experimented more than before.
