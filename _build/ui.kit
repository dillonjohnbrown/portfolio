    <p>This site is my latest work. I designed and coded this little website.</p>
	<p><a href="https://tacomapw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tacoma Pressure Wash</a> is a side project of mine. I love cleaning and I just discovered how great power tools can be. Even in it's unfinished state, I proudly display it here before everything else.</p>

    <h4>Harvest Profit</h4>
    <p>Harvest Profit is a software company in Fargo, ND. Their products include a mobile app, consulting services, and a subscription-based web app. Here are some highlights from my time working with them.</p>

				<p>Along with some swag, this guide was printed and mailed to every new customer. I was given near full creative control over the project. The modern style I created evolved into the look of the web app.</p>

				<p>This is the first thing you see after purchasing access to the software. Previously, there was no onboarding &mdash; you were just dumped into the web app. I designed this to help you get everything you need into the app, so you can use the software right away.</p>
				<p><a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/d1ZWE/Mywe0yl/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a demo of the onboarding process.</a></p>

				<p>Farming can get complicated fast. With this software farmers track the details of their fields. Each field can have one or more plantings, each planting one or more crops, and each planting can be subdivided between different farmers or businesses (called "share agreements" in my designs, and "entity splits" on the current page).</p>
				<p>My job was to take what they had (top image), add a few new features and make the whole thing easier to use. <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/mOa79/oYPWwkn/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is my work on the feature</a> and <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/mOa79/VrxDPor/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is where the page is today</a>.</p>
				<p>The biggest change I made was to separate the share agreements to their own tab. In addition to cleaning up the interface, this allows you to save and apply them to different plantings (e.g., you and your neighbor regularly share the work on the fields where your properties meet).</p>

		<p>The current page (left/top) needs some work. Buttons look like text, white-space has been abused, and little care has been given to it as a whole. Basically it is a mess. My idea (right/bottom) adds new features and makes it easier to use.</p>
		<p>This is a fun one to play with. <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/75OjY/OmjWEav/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take a look at my work</a> and <a href="https://sketch.cloud/s/75OjY/v82WoO4/play" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">where the page is now</a>.</p>

		<p>This was one of the first pages I overhauled (eagle-eyed viewers will notice some less evolved styles here). A new design language is the first thing you'll notice. More suble changes include translating Engineer-ese to English, like "Export" to "Download".</p>
