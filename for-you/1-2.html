				<h2>1.2 (SECOND TIME)</h2>
				<p>Clothes strewn in a path leading to the bedroom. The bed is tossed. We pant, exhausted, sweating, and blissful. Finally the last of our walls are let down. The pillows have never felt so soft. I brush your hair from your face. You respond with crescent eyes and an easy smile.</p>
				<p>For a long time we don't say a word &mdash; there is no need. Laying together, nose to nose, our eyes say everything. We touch, we laugh, our eyes half-open. One of us finally whispers something silly and we howl.</p>
				<p>Warmth, relief, acceptance &mdash; it feels like home. It's nice to hear your voice. Legs entwined, our bodies melt together.</p>
				<p>Lights low. We're thrilled and exhausted. We slip through the night, gathering energy to kiss, between dips in and out of consciousness.</p>
				<p>Then, a surge.</p>
