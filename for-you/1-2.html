				<h2>1.2 (SECOND TIME)</h2>
				<p>The bed is a mess, our clothes strewn in a path to the bedroom. We pant, exhausted, sweating, and blissful. Finally the last of our walls are let down. The pillows have never felt so soft. I brush your hair from your face. You respond with crescent eyes and an easy smile. Eyes prickle with water out of happiness.</p>
				<p>For a long time we don't say a word &mdash; we don't need to. Laying together, nose to nose, our eyes say everything. We touch, we laugh, our eyes half-open. One of us finally says something silly and we howl.</p>
				<p>Warmth, acceptance, a sense of being at home. It's nice to hear your voice. Legs entwined, our bodies melt together.</p>
				<p>Lights lit low. We slip through the night, gathering energy to kiss, between dips in and out of consciousness. A surge.</p>
