				<h2>1.2.1 (ASSPOUNDTOWN)</h2>
				<p>My hands can't help but to indulge in you. Fingers traced up and down over exposed curves. Like honey we flow. Gentle lips land between a flurry of massages.

				 My hands hold you just the way you are.</p>
				<p class="wwword lady">That feels nice, his hands are strong. He's holding back.</p>
				<p class="wwword lady">What is he doing. Is he..? Wait &mdash; easy around my bare ass, bucko...</p>
				<p class="wwword lady">...I don't even care, those hands melt away my stress. How can I possibly hold tension in my butt? He can't possibly be enjoying this &mdash; this feels amazing, it's a little uncomfortable but so relieving.</p>
				<p class="wwword gentleman">"What did you say?"</p>
				<p class="wwword lady">...</p>
				<p class="wwword gentleman">"You just said something about butt tension...?"</p>
